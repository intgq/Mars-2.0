## **Dependencies**
### **Lark**
Used in: all

For HCSP code translation and generation, we use lark frame to build our parser. You may install lark by direction of their official guide:https://lark-parser.readthedocs.io/en/stable/

### **Node**
Used in:hhlpy, hcsp_simulator

For gui of hhlpy and hcsp_simulator, we use Javascript to write frontend,so Node is needed. You may install Node by direction of their official guide:https://nodejs.org/

### **Flask**
Used in:hhlpy, hcsp_simulator

For backend of hcsp_simulator, we use Flask frame to write backend. You may install Flask by direction of their official guide:https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/

### **Isabelle**
Used in: HHLProver

HHLProver is an extension of Isabelle,so you may install Isabelle2023 from:
https://isabelle.in.tum.de/, for details, see[HHLProver_README](./HHLProver/README.md)

### **Ubuntu 20.04**
Used in: hcsp2c

In hcsp2c, certain package for compile is only in linux, so linux system is need.
For windows users, wsl2.0 may make things easier, see https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install

In Ubuntu, gcc needs to be installed with cmd
```cmd
   sudo apt install gcc   
```

## **Tool chain Usages**
### **AADL2HCSP**


To translate AADL to HCSP, first run aadl2json.py in folder "Mars2.0/tools", name of startfile, config file and the dir folder path of them needs to be specified as arguments, for example, 

```cmd
    python tools/aadl2json.py -d Examples/AADL/CCS/AADL -sf joint_model_nobus.aadl -cf config.json  
```
and the output JSON file is under the dir folder path, then translate it to HCSP by running json2hcsp.py in folder "Mars2.0/tools", name of JSON file and the output dir needs to be specified as arguments, for example,

```cmd
    python tools/json2hcsp.py -jf Examples/AADL/CCS/AADL/joint_model_nobus.json -od Examples/AADL/CCS/TCS/generatedcode_nobus
```
Note: for model with multipule files that consists of usage "import", path of imported HCSP module needs to be written in ss2hcsp/import_path.txt, you may create this file and maintain it manually

### **Simulink/Stateflow2HCSP**

To tranlate S/S model to HCSP, first you need to convert S/S model(mdl or xls file) to .xml file, matlab provide following cmd:

```Matlab
    save_system('*.mdl', '*.xml','ExportToXML', true)
```
hint: when running this cmd, model needs to be opened in simulink

and then you can use ssxml2hcsp.py in folder "Mars2.0/tools" to translate xml file to HCSP file. Input and output dir needs to be specified as arguments, for example,

```cmd
    python tools/ssxml2hcsp.py -in Examples/Simulink/LunarLander.xml -out Examples/Simulink/LunarLander.txt
```

### **HCSP simulator**
Our HCSP simulator includes frontend and backend.
To open Frontend, first get into the folder "hcsp_simulator" by 
 ```cmd
    cd hcsp_simulator
```
and run npm by
 ```cmd
    npm start
```
Note: you may re-build the project before use, by getting in the folder and run npm build, the guide (generated automatically by Node) is [hcsp_simulator_README](./hcsp_simulator/README.md)

### **Formally verification**
We provide 2 ways of formally verification
1) hhlpy, based on Wolfram Engine, and the usage of it see [hhlpy_README](./hhlpy/README.md)
2) HHLprover+ Isabelle, usage of it see [HHLProver_README](./HHLProver/README.md)

### **HCSP2C**

To turn HCSP to C file, first run hcsp2Ccode.py in folder "Mars2.0/tools", for example,

```cmd
    python tools/hcsp2Ccode.py -sf using/output_files/TCS/hcsp/systemv2.txt -dd using/output_files/TCS/Ccode -df systemv2 -step 1e-4 -mt 40.0
```

and then copy the generated C code, Mars2.0/hcsp2c/target/hcsp2c.h ,Mars2.0/hcsp2c/target/hcsp2c.c and compile.sh to linux (in the same folder), and run  

```cmd
    bash compile.sh
```

then run the outputfile, you may use '>' to put outputs into a txt file


```cmd
    xx.output > xx.txt
```
