# hhlprover
## usage
   1. Install Isabelle2023 from:<br>
        https://isabelle.in.tum.de/  <br>
   2. Download the afp package from :<br>
        https://www.isa-afp.org/ <br>
        we need to make the whole AFP available to Isabelle (we use the version afp-2023-12-06) <br>
   3. Launch Isabelle2023 and then change logic session to "Ordinary_Differential_Equations" <br>
      Session change requires restart and then waiting for the session to be proved for the first time. <br>
      If the target session is not found, it means step 2 was not completed. <br> 
   4. Add the relative mars package path ".../Mars2.0/hhlprover" into the ROOTS file in Isabelle2023 <br>
      If an error dialog box is displayed while launching Isabelle2023, it means this step was not completed.
   5. Open the following files in this package in Isabelle2023 <br>
        "Mars2.0\Examples\lander\Lander1.thy" <br>
	      "Mars2.0\Examples\lander\Lander2.thy" <br>
        "Mars2.0\Examples\CTCS3\C.thy" <br>
      If step 4 secceeds, Isabelle2023 will automatically import the dependent files in HHLprover. <br>
